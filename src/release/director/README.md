This Processing sketch directs the game, and both Arduinos, communicating with them through the serial port.

The sketch has a screen, but this is only used for debug purposes. In an installation, this sketch could be installed to a headless Raspberry Pi, and just leave the electronic components visible.

If you need to restart the game, stop the sketch and re-run it.

## Requirements

In order to run this sketch, you need to compile and upload the Arduino sketches to their respective boards. Then connect them through USB.

You need to install Processing 3 either in your PC or in the Raspberry Pi.

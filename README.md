# Closed Encounters of the Fixed Kind

A game made for the Global Game Jam 2020, from Brighton, with care. January 31st - February 2nd, 2020.

For Zunilda and Sonia, who I keep in my mind and heart constantly.

## About this repo

This repo contains the source code for this physical computing game. Each sketch has a README that explains their corresponding hardware and software requirements.

The source code is divided in two directories: the release directory that contains what was delivered at the end of the jam.

## Hardware requirements

This game requires the following hardware:

* Arduino Uno board
* RGB matrix shield for Arduino (although the screen can be connected directly by pins, but life is short)
* RGB LED matrix screen, 32x32
* Arduino Mega board
* Adafruit Music Maker shield, with MIDI mode on
* Speaker
* Neotrellis board with buttons (x1)
* Breadboard with two buttons
* A Raspberry Pi that connects both Arduinos through USB. Note: a PC was used to develop this, but since the director is written in Processing, there's no reason to think it cannot work on the Pi

## Protip diversifier

This jam I tried to claim for the Protip diversifier:

* Slept 8 hours from Friday to Saturday
* Slept 5 hours from Saturday to Sunday
* Biked 15 minutes each way each day from home to the jam venue and back
* Had home-cooked food on Saturday for breakfast, lunch and dinner
